This lecture was aiming at developping skills for studying time series data. 
The caracteristics of the yields of a stock were studied in order to calculate a parametric Value at Risk. 
Then the parametric Value at Risk has been backtested and compared to other VaRs (Normal, Historical and Cornish-Fisher).
